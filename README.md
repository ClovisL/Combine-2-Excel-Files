# Using a Google Colab notebook, you can upload 2 Excel files to be combined into a single file.
https://colab.research.google.com/github/ClovisL/Combine-2-Excel-Files/blob/main/Combine2ExcelFiles.ipynb

## This is intended for spreadsheets that contain the same columns with the same type of data, but have different ranges (for example, combine data from the month of July with data from the month of June)
If files with different columns are added, NaN values will be placed for any rows that do not have a value in a column.
